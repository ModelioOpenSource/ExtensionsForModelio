= SysML Use case diagrams

SysML Use case diagrams describe how a system is used by its environment (external actors). The system provides services which are used by the actors in order to realize their goals. Use case diagrams are often seen as a picture of the list of functionalities provided by the system and the set of interacting user types or external systems.
