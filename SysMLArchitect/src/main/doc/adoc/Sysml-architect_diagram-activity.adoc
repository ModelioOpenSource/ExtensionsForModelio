= SysML Activity diagrams

SysML Activity diagrams are dedicated to specifying the flow of inputs/outputs and control, including sequences and conditions for activities.

Most of the elements required for modeling the activity behavior of a Block element come from UML Activity diagrams. SysML adds some further extensions, such as support of continuous flow modeling.
