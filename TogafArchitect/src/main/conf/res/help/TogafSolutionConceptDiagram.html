<html><b>SolutionConcept</b><p> </p><p> A Solution Concept diagram provides a high-level orientation of the solution that is envisaged in order to meet the objectives of the architecture engagement. In contrast to the more formal and detailed architecture diagrams developed in the following phases, the solution concept represents a pencil sketch of the expected solution at the outset of the engagement. This diagram may embody key objectives, requirements, and constraints for the engagement and also highlight work areas to be investigated in more detail with formal architecture modeling. The purpose of this diagram is to quickly on-board and align stakeholders for a particular change initiative, so that all participants understand what the architecture engagement is seeking to achieve and how it is expected that a particular solution approach will meet the needs of the enterprise.</p><p> Hints : Present only the main application components of the solution, and summarize their connections using the "access" dependency. Connect them to existing applications when necessary. Connect them to requirements, processes or functions, themselves connected to goals. Also express ("consumes" dependency) which role uses which component.</p><p> Under Modelio : Create of drag & drop the components. Drag & drop the relevant requirements, goals, processes, functions or business services. Unmask or create the appropriate dependencies (consumes, satisfy, assigned, ...)</p></html>
