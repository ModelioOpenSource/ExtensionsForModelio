<html><b>OrganizationDecomposition</b><p> </p><p> An Organization Decomposition diagram describes the links between actors, roles, and locations within an organization tree. An organization map should provide a chain of command of owners and decision makers in the organization. Although it is not the intent of the Organization Decomposition diagram to link goal to organization, it should be possible to intuitively link the goals to the stakeholders from the Organization Decomposition diagram.</p><p> This diagram can also describe the definition of actors and their responsibilities : the organization is presented in terms of connections between actors, or between actors and organization units showing hierarchical links, communications and responsibilities.</p><p> Missions and responsibilities within an organization can also be emphasized by presenting the main information flows circulating between the major participants of the enterprise. This presents which information is received, processes or emitted by who in the organization, showing thus the responsibilities of organizational elements.</p><p> Organization decomposition diagrams are also used to define the different roles assumed by actors.</p><p> Under Modelio : organization units can be deployed under locations (drag & drop organization units from the explorer to locations in the diagram). "Assumes" dependencies express which actor plays which role, "localization" dependencies express where roles or actors are localized. As in every diagram, goals can be dragged and dropped, and traced to organizations roles.</p></html>
