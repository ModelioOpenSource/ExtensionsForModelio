<html><b>CommunicationEngineerings</b><p> </p><p> The Communications Engineering diagram describes the means of communication, the method of sending and receiving information between these assets in the Technology Architecture; insofar as the selection of package solutions in the preceding architectures put specific requirements on the communications between the applications. The Communications Engineering diagram will take logical connections between client and server components and identify network boundaries and network infrastructure required to physically implement those connections. It does not describe the information format or content, but will address protocol and capacity issues.</p><p> See NewtorkComputingHardware Diagram: the focus is set here on communications.</p></html>
