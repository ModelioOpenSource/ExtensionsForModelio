<html><b>ProcessSystemRealization</b><p> </p><p> The purpose of the Process/System Realization diagram is to clearly depict the sequence of events when multiple applications are involved in executing a business process. It enhances the Application Communication diagram by augmenting it with any sequencing constraints, and hand-off points between batch and real-time processing. It would identify complex sequences that could be simplified, and identify possible rationalization points in the architecture in order to provide more timely information to business users. It may also identify process efficiency improvements that may reduce interaction traffic between applications.</p><p> Under Modelio : Drag & drop the processes that you want to illustrate, drag & drop the Application components that are involved, and draw "component realization" dependencies. Indications of role or order can be made using information flows (as in the example), or notes attached to elements. </p></html>
