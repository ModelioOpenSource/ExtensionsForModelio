<html><b>DataLifeCycle</b><p> </p><p> The Data Lifecycle diagram is an essential part of managing business data throughout its lifecycle from conception until disposal within the constraints of the business process. The data is considered as an entity in its own right, decoupled from business process and activity. Each change in state is represented on the diagram which may include the event or rules that trigger that change in state. The separation of data from process allows common data requirements to be identified which enables resource sharing to be achieved more effectively.</p><p> - Hints: Identify the possible states of the entity (for example, a document can be "underCreation", "underRevision", "approved", etc.), and define the possible transitions between each states. A state must be a stable situation of a data : when no action is executed on it, the data is always in one of the identified states.</p></html>
