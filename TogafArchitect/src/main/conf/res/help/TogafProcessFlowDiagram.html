<html><b>ProcessFlow</b><p> </p><p> Business Process modeling is done using process flow diagrams.</p><p> The purpose of the Process Flow diagram is to depict all models and mappings related to a process. Process Flow diagrams show sequential flows of control between activities and may utilize swim lane techniques to represent ownership and realization of process steps. For example, the application that supports a process step may be shown as a swim-lane. In addition to showing a sequence of activities, process flows can also be used to detail the controls that apply to a process, the events that trigger or result from completion of a process, and also the products that are generated from process execution. Process Flow diagrams are useful in elaborating the architecture with subject specialists, as they allow the specialist to describe how the job is done for a particular function. Through this process, each process step can become a more fine-grained function and can then in turn be elaborated as a process.</p><p> Under Modelio : Process Flow diagram are modeled using BPMN. Pools and lanes can be assigned to existing roles, actors or organization units. Business Entities can be used to type data objects, and there states (from their data lifecycle diagrams) can be shown during the processing.</p></html>
