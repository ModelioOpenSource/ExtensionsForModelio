<html><b>NewtorkComputingHardware</b><p> </p><p> Starting with the transformation to client-server systems from mainframes and later with the advent of e-Business and J2EE, large enterprises moved predominantly into a highly network based distributed network computing environment with firewalls and demilitarized zones. Currently, most of the applications have a web front-end and, looking at the deployment architecture of these applications, it is very common to find three distinct layers in the network landscape; namely a web presentation layer, a business logic or application layer, and a backend data store layer. It is a common practice for applications to be deployed and hosted in a shared and common infrastructure environment. So it becomes highly critical to document the mapping between logical applications and the technology components (e.g., server) that supports the application both in the development and production environments. The purpose of this diagram is to show the deployed logical view of logical application components in a distributed network computing environment.</p><p> Under Modelio: Create workstations, servers and connect them using network devices and association. Then, deploy application components by drag & dropping them to workstations and servers. You can also link roles or actors to their environment.</p></html>
