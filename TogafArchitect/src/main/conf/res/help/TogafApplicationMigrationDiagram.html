<html><b>ApplicationMigration</b><p> </p><p> The Application Migration diagram identifies application migration from baseline to target application components. It enables a more accurate estimation of migration costs by showing precisely which applications and interfaces need to be mapped between migration stages.</p><p> Under Modelio : One strategy is to model the global Information system as a system application component for each of its state. Under the context of each version of the system, instances of application components will be created (just drag & drop application components under the system component). This allows showing several instances of identical components deployed in several versions of the IS. Between these instances, "migration" dependencies are drawn. The model can be more accurate, and focused for example on different versions of services on different occurrences of application components.</p></html>
