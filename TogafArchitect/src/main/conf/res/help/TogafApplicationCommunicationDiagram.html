<html><b>ApplicationCommunication</b><p> </p><p> The purpose of the Application Communication diagram is to depict all models and mappings related to communication between applications in the metamodel entity. It shows application components and interfaces between components. Interfaces may be associated with data entities where appropriate. Applications may be associated with business services where  appropriate. Communication should be logical and should only show intermediary technology where it is architecturally relevant.</p><p> Hints : Use Application components to present as much as possible an SOA oriented architecture. Application components have different kinds that allows structuring them into layers, the main one being : GUI (interaction), Process, Entity. An Application Architecture may be hybrid due to the legacy system or external applications : "Application" or "DataBase" components serve this purpose, and can be mixed with SOA oriented service components. Application components are connected via required or provided services which are connected through connectors. Provided/Required services are typed by IS services that are generally modeled elsewhere.</p></html>
