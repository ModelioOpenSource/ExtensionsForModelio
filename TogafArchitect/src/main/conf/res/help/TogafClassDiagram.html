<html><b>Class</b><p> </p><p> The key purpose of the Class diagram is to depict the relationships among the critical data entities (or classes) within the enterprise. This diagram is developed to clearly present the relationships and to help understand the lower-level data models for the enterprise.</p><p> Hints : this diagram is at a high level of representation (conceptual). We are here interested in modeling the main business entities, their properties and relationships. The persistency model (typically for RDB) will be inferred later at the application layer.</p><p> Under Modelio : This is a class diagram, where the main notion is the "Business Entity".</p></html>
