<html><b>DataMigration</b><p> </p><p> The purpose of the Data Migration diagram is to show the flow of data from the source to the target applications. The diagram will provide a visual representation of the spread of sources/targets and serve as a tool for data auditing and establishing traceability. This diagram can be elaborated or enhanced as detailed as necessary. For example, the diagram can contain just an overall layout of migration landscape or could go into individual application metadata element level of detail.</p><p> Hints : Data migration can be expressed at the conceptual level, logical or physical. It can also use application communication diagrams to express the data migration. The "migrate" dependency is the key element to formalize migration.</p><p> Under Modelio : Use the previous data model (which should be in a separated information domain), drag and drop previous and new entities, and use the "migrates" dependency to express how previous data is translated into new entities.</p></html>
