<html><b>DataDissemination</b><p> </p><p> The purpose of the Data Dissemination diagram is to show the relationship between data entities, business services, and application components. The diagram shows how the logical entities are to be physically realized by application components. This allows effective sizing to be carried out and the IT footprint to be refined. Moreover, by assigning business value to data, an indication of the business criticality of application components can be gained. Additionally, the diagram may show data replication and system ownership of the master reference for data. In this instance, it can show two copies and the master-copy relationship between them. This diagram can include services; that is, services encapsulate data and they reside in an application, or services that reside on an application and access data encapsulated within the application</p><p> Under Modelio : Data dissemination diagram is a kind of architecture diagram, where data entities are connected to application components. First, drag & drop application components from the application architecture, and then drag and drop business entities, either within the application components to show their localization, or beside them, with dependency links.</p></html>
