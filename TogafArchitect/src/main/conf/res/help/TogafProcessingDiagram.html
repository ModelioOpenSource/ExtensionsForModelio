<html><b>Processing</b><p> </p><p> The Processing diagram focuses on deployable units of code/configuration and how these are deployed onto the technology platform. A deployment unit represents grouping of business function, service, or application components. The Processing diagram addresses the following:</p><p> - Which set of application components need to be grouped to form a deployment unit</p><p> - How one deployment unit connects/interacts with another (LAN, WAN, and the applicable protocols)</p><p> - How application configuration and usage patterns generate load or capacity requirements for different technology components</p><p> See NewtorkComputingHardware Diagram. Processing diagram will use deployment in a more generic way, in order to present deployment units. Deployment units can be presented as component instances where application components are deployed, or as physical utility component that will host the deployed application component (for example: an application server).</p><p> Associations between these deployment units will represent the connection (as for example network), information flows will indicate the nature of information exchanged. </p><p> On these diagrams, indications about capacity requirements are provided.</p><p> Under Modelio : Drag & drop application components to deploy them into the deployable units of configuration, which are themself specific kinds of application components, at a logical technology level.</p></html>
