<html><b>BusinessServiceInformation</b><p> </p><p> The Business Service/Information diagram shows the information needed to support one or more business services. The Business Service/Information diagram shows what data is consumed by or produced by a business service and may also show the source of information. The Business Service/Information diagram shows an initial representation of the information present within the architecture and therefore forms a basis for elaboration and refinement within Phase C (Data Architecture).</p><p> Hints : by using "flow" dependencies between  business services and business entities, this diagram represents which kind of entity is used or produced by the services. </p><p> Under Modelio : drag and drop business services and business entities from the explorer, and draw "flow" dependencies between them to express inputs or outputs. Flow properties provide the means to specify the input or output orientation.</p></html>
