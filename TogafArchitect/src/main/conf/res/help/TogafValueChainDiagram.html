<html><b>ValueChain</b><p> </p><p> A Value Chain diagram provides a high-level orientation view of an enterprise and how it interacts with the outside world. In contrast to the more formal Functional Decomposition diagram developed within Phase B (Business Architecture), the Value Chain diagram focuses on presentational impact. The purpose of this diagram is to quickly on-board and align stakeholders for a particular change initiative, so that all participants understand the high-level functional and organizational context of the architecture engagement. A usual practice consists in showing a simplified business process diagram, and for each task defining its value factors and changes needed.</p><p> Under Modelio : Use sequence dependencies between functions to express value chains. The " Value factors" and "changes needed" types of notes are expressing this key information.</p></html>
