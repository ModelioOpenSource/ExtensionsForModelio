<html><b>PlatformDecomposition</b><p> </p><p> The Platform Decomposition diagram depicts the technology platform that supports the operations of the Information Systems Architecture. The diagram covers all aspects of the infrastructure platform and provides an overview of the enterprise's technology platform. The diagram can be expanded to map the technology platform to appropriate application components within a specific functional or process area. This diagram may show details of specification, such as product versions, number of CPUs, etc., or simply could be an informal eye-char t providing an overview of the technical environment. The diagram should clearly show the enterprise applications and the technology platform for each application area can further be decomposed as follows for Hardware and Software: Logical Technology Components (with attributes), Physical Technology Components (with attributes). Depending upon the scope of the enterprise architecture work, additional technology crossplatform information (e.g., communications, telco, and video information) may be addressed. It is a specific focus on network computing diagrams.</p><p> See also network computing diagrams.</p></html>
