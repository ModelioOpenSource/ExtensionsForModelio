<html><b>SofwareDistribution</b><p> The Software Distribution diagram shows how application software is structured and distributed across the estate. It is useful in systems upgrade or application consolidation projects. This diagram shows how physical applications are distributed across physical technology and the location of that technology. This enables a clear view of how the software is hosted, but also enables managed operations staff to understand how that application software is maintained once installed.</p><p>Same principle as network computing diagram, but the focus here is on software, and physical environments.</p></html>
