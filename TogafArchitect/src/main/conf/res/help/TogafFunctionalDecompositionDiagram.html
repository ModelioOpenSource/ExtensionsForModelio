<html><b>FunctionalDecomposition</b><p> </p><p> The purpose of the Functional Decomposition diagram is to show on a single page the capabilities of an organization that are relevant to the consideration of an architecture. By examining the capabilities of an organization from a functional perspective, it is possible to quickly develop models of what the organization does without being dragged into extended debate on how the organization does it. Once a basic Functional Decomposition diagram has been developed, it becomes possible to layer heat-maps on top of this diagram to show scope and decisions. For example, the capabilities to be implemented in different phases of a change program.</p><p> Under Modelio : Dedicated dependencies can be used to enrich the model, for example to indicate which application components support which function, which role uses which function, etc. Function decomposition can be expressed by "containment" (just create a function in another function), or by using the "part" dependency.</p></html>
