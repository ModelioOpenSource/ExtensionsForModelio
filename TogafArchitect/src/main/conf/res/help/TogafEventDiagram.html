<html><b>Event</b><p> </p><p> Also called "process map"</p><p> The purpose of the Event diagram is to depict the relationship between events and process. Certain events such as arrival of certain information (e.g., customer submits sales order) or a certain point in time (e.g., end of fiscal quarter)  cause work and certain actions need to be undertaken within the business. These are often referred to as business events or simply events and are considered as triggers for a process. It is important to note that the event has to trigger a process and generate a business response or result.</p><p> Under Modelio:  Events are connected to processes using "flow" dependencies, roles can be initiator or participant to processes, products can be connected to processes through the "flow" dependencies.</p></html>
