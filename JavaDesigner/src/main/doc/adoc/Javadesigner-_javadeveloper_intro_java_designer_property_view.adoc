=== Introduction

The Java property view is used to enter or modify certain information relevant to Java generation on the element selected in Modelio, such as <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_note_types.adoc#,notes>>, <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_tagged_value_types.adoc#,tagged values>> or <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_stereo_types.adoc#,stereotypes>>.

=== The Java Designer property view on a package

Key:

1.  The “Java element” field is used to add the << JavaPackage >> stereotype, indicating that the package is handled by Java.
2.  The “No code” field is used to add the \{JavaNoCode} tagged value, indicating that the package will not be generated.

The icons at the top of the window are used as follows:

* image:images/Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_intro_java_designer_property_view_generate.png[image]: This icon is used to launch Java generation.

* image:images/Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_intro_java_designer_property_view_javadocgenerate.png[image]: This icon is used to launch Javadoc generation.
* image:images/Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_intro_java_designer_property_view_visualize.png[image]: This icon is used visualize the generated Javadoc in a web browser. Grayed if the Javadoc is not generated.

13. The “Key” field is used to add the second parameter to the \{type} tagged value. It indicates the key type to use for container types like HashMap.
14. The “No init value” field is used to disable generation of the attribute’s initial value.
15. The “Template binding” field is used to specify parameters if the attribute’s datatype is a generic type.
