=== Before starting

Before an application can be run from a compilation artifact, the application in question must have been compiled. The Jar file must also have been built.

The {JavaMainClass(< FullClassPath >)} tagged value is used to specify the main class of the application. This class will be used when the application is launched from Modelio.
