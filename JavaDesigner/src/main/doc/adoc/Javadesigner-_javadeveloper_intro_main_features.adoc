[[Generating-Java-files]]

[[generating-java-files]]
=== Generating Java files

Java code generation consists of producing Java files for a modelâ€™s classes, using the <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_java_code_and_modeling_correspondence.adoc#,correspondence between Java notions and modeling notions>>.

Modelio Java Designer has a default strategy for generating parameter and attribute declarations. It converts UML types into Java 5 types, ensuring modern code generation, based on the Java collections framework. Other translations can be implemented easily, using the Modelio Java Designer <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_customizing_java_generation_customization_file.adoc#,customization file>>.

*_Note:_* Before actually generating, it may be necessary to specify that classes or packages are Java elements using <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_stereo_types.adoc#,stereotypes>> or to annotate the model using <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_tagged_value_types.adoc#,tagged values>> and <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_generating_java_code_note_types.adoc#,notes>>.

[[Generating-documentation]]

[[generating-documentation]]
=== Generating documentation

<<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_java_doc_generation_overview.adoc#,Java documentation generation>> uses the <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_intro_gloss.adoc#,JDK>> javadoc tool to produce HTML files from the generated java files. This operation is therefore related to the generated java files. <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_java_doc_generation_java_doc_generation_note_types.adoc#,Special notes>>, inserted during the modeling phase and taken into account during code generation, are then used.

[[Compiling-generated-files]]

[[compiling-generated-files]]
=== Compiling generated files

The <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_ant_generation_gen_build_ant_file.adoc#,compilation of generated files>> consists of producing the class files from generated Java files. For this, Modelio Java Designer proposes the generation and execution of ANT files.

[[Reverse-engineering]]

[[reverse-engineering]]
=== Reverse engineering

The reverse engineering operation consists of incorporating classes of existing libraries, especially the <<Javadesigner-_javadeveloper_intro_gloss.adoc#,JDK>>, into a model. During the modeling phase, this allows you to:

* specialize these classes
* implement them
* create associations towards them
* create attributes that have one of these classes as their type
* create methods parameters that have one of these classes as their type

The reverse feature also allows you to reverse your developed code into a Modelio model.
